ðŸ“„ Screentime & Mental Health Project
Goal:
Explore whether higher daily screen time correlates with lower mental health scores, poor sleep quality, or demographic trends.

Key Questions Tested:

Does higher screen time relate to lower mental health scores?

Do specific devices (phone, laptop, tablet) matter more?

Are there differences by age or generation?

Does screen time affect sleep quality?

What I Did:

Cleaned and explored data from Kaggle using SQL and Excel.

Split data into top & bottom 25% mental health score groups.

Compared average screen time by device and generation.

Created trend lines and correlation tests.

Key Findings:

No strong correlation between total screen time and mental health scores (r â‰ˆ 0.007).

No meaningful difference between top & bottom 25% groups in device usage.

Slight generational difference: Gen Z reports lower mental health than other groups, but the dataset is too small to generalize.

Virtually no correlation between screen time and sleep quality.

Takeaway:
This dataset didnâ€™t show clear trends. A larger or more detailed dataset could help control for confounders like income or stress. This project demonstrates my ability to test a hypothesis, accept a null result, and suggest next steps.

Tools: SQL, Excel, data cleaning, pivot tables, visualizations.
